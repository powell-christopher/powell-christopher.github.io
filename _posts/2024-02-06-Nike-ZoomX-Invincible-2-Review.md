I like the Nike ZoomX Invincible Run Flyknit 2. 

First impression of the shoe right out of the box is their bulk in terms of size, especially in terms of platform width. But while noticeable, it didn't bother me. Weight-wise it is perfectly adequate. Not lightweight but not heavy on foot either. 

A lot is said about their energy return, and while they do have decent energy return it is nowhere close to anything with even a TPU plate. What they do have is amazing shock absorption. The amount of stress they remove from the legs is so high that during my first runs in them I had a problem keeping my HR in check as my legs were so fresh. I have come to rely on them as a way to increase my running volume while keeping my legs (and joints especially) as fresh as possible. This is where this shoe shines.

The softness of the midsole can be a double edged sword however. For one, this is far far away from a stability shoe. If you need stability, you won't find it here. The platform width makes it so you never feel like you're falling off the shoe. However, the midsole does compress quite a lot and that causes inherent instability. Also, I am not sure I would consider this shoe to be beginner friendly. While it would definitely assist in taking away some impact stress, especially for a heavier runner, the midsole is so soft that you get very little feedback from the shoe. If you're doing something wrong it may take you a while to notice it and by that point the repetitive strain may have already caused an injury. So please be aware of that.

Grip is very good. The width of the platform combined with the outsole pattern basically guarantees good grip in all situations.

The upper is also OK. A bit too bulky, but that fits with the relaxed nature of the shoe. I found that a runner's knot was helpful in making sure i had a good lock-in feel, however that is possibly due to the fact that I could have potentially gone down half a size. Breathability is good for this sort of shoe. It is not a race-day shoe, but it won't make your feet sweat either. No issues with hot spots for me. 

How does this show fit my rotation? The Invincible is an amazing recovery run shoe. It can also double up as a long run shoe and even as a daily trainer. However, it won't be the best in those situations. For long runs I prefer a shoe with a bit more structure as I feel that helps once weariness sets in and my form starts breaking down a bit. For a daily trainer it does the job, and while its energy return means you could use it for say tempo work or some strides, I would opt for a lighter, less cumbersome shoe when picking up the pace.

Durability for me has been good. As of time of writing I have run approx. 400km in them and they still look and feel like new.

In terms of value for money, it is an expensive shoe as far as recovery shoes go. However, its flexibility, the unique features it delivers and its durability make it worth it for me, especially if you can find it at a discounted price. 

Recommended.
