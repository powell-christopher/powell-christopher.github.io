Hello World ... again!

After a bit of a hiatus on my personal blog, to keep up with career and personal goals, I decided I wanted to give this a push as I value the opportunity of reaching out to the community and sharing ideas.

<!--more-->

In the spirit of new beginnings, I have updated this blog, this time based on Jekyll instead of Hexo for better github-pages integration.

I also decided I want to start sharing more of my interests, not just the technical realm. You will thus find various categories for topics. More will be added in time. I hope you will join me on this journey and I look forward to feedback and discussion.

Thanks!
