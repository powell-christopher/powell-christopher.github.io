In the realm of organizational development, it's tempting to address issues by introducing new tools or processes. However, such solutions often treat symptoms rather than root causes. There are not shortcuts to building a resilient and effective organization. Let's discuss...

---

### **Values: The Foundation**

Values are the core principles that guide behavior and decision-making within an organization. They are not just words on a wall but are demonstrated through actions and choices. Without clearly defined and communicated values, any attempt to shape culture or implement processes will lack direction and coherence.

Values are not the same thing as Expectations or Desired Outcomes. These as well are downstream from values. Defining clear expectations is a good thing. However, relying exclusively on explicitly defined expectations is less than ideal. If the values of the organization are clear to all, it not only makes defining explicit expectations easier, but (together with industry specific knowledge) will also provide an even larger set of implicit requirements or expectations.

### **Culture: The Manifestation of Values**

Culture emerges from the consistent application of values. It's the shared understanding of "how we do things here." A strong culture aligns with the organization's values, fostering an environment where employees feel connected and motivated. Attempting to impose a culture without a foundation of shared values often leads to resistance and confusion. 

### **Process: Structuring the Culture**

Processes are the formalized methods by which tasks are accomplished. They provide consistency and efficiency. However, processes should be designed to support the existing culture, not to define or replace it. Implementing processes that conflict with the organization's culture can create friction and reduce effectiveness.

### **Tooling: Supporting the Process**

Tools are the resources and technologies used to execute processes. While they can enhance productivity, tools should be selected and implemented to support existing processes. Relying on tools to fix broken processes or to instill culture is a misstep. Tools are enablers, not solutions in themselves.

### **Building from the Ground Up**

When facing organizational challenges, it's crucial to assess and address issues at the foundational level:

1. Define and communicate clear values.
2. Foster a culture that embodies these values.
3. Develop processes that align with and support the culture.
4. Select tools that enhance and facilitate these processes.

By adhering to this hierarchy, organizations can create a cohesive and effective environment that is resilient to change and aligned in purpose.

### **A Counter Argument**

As one might say, there is more than one way to skin a cat. What is described above might be the preferred way forward, but it is not the only way. Let's elaborate...

#### **Following the Greats**

Learning from those that have preceded us and have been successful is critical. We stand on the shoulders of giants. However, it is also critical to understand what the lessons are and how they can apply to our own situation. There is a difference between learning and simply mimicking.

Adopting a value system because one sees intrinsic value in it is one thing; adopting it because of the expectation of success when the value itself is not shared or appreciated is another.

Expecting to just be able to transplant or emulate culture probably won't work as expected. For one, the two organizations will be different in a host of ways, and impacted by different factors. Secondly, importing culture without its foundational values means there are no solid roots or foundations. Possibly not even a real understanding of what the culture is all about, replaced instead by skin-deep perception. 

The same applies to taking on processes or tooling. It is smart to adopt tried and tested processing and tooling, if upon analysis one finds that it is a good fit.

This approach can thus lead into pitfalls, but it can also lead to lessons being learned painfully over time, thus achieving iterative improvement and eventual success.

#### **Fake It Till You Make It**

Sometimes you have to fake it till you make it. You may introduce something you don't really understand or appreciate the nuance of. Less than ideal. However, it can be the case that this has a limited or short term positive effect that can be a springboard for further improvement and refinement.

#### **Top-Down Change**

It may be the case that organization leadership wants to instill change, and it is believed that the top-down introduction of change will help in achieving that goal.

By its very nature, this will cause friction and pain. Such an attempt thus requires a lot of top-down buy-in. It is understood that there will be pain, but it is agreed to persevere because the belief is it will be positive in the longer term. 

If the buy-in is there and it is steadfast, coupled with the openness to change direction as new information becomes available, then the desired outcome can be achieved, albeit through a period of uncertainty and pain.

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Start with Values**
Clearly defined values are the foundation of any effective organization. They inform culture, clarify expectations, and guide decision-making.

2. **Culture Flows from Values**
A strong, authentic culture emerges when values are consistently lived out—not imposed or copied. It’s “how we do things here” made visible.

3. **Process Should Support Culture**
Process brings structure, but it must align with and reinforce the culture—not override or contradict it.

4. **Tooling Is Not a Fix for Deeper Issues**
Tools enhance existing processes but can't compensate for broken culture or unclear values. Tooling is the final layer, not the foundation.

5. **Avoid Cargo Cult Thinking**
Simply mimicking successful companies’ culture, processes, or tooling without understanding the values underpinning them leads to shallow and unsustainable results.

6. **“Fake It Till You Make It” Is a Risky but Sometimes Useful Strategy**
Introducing change prematurely might create momentum, but success depends on growing real understanding and alignment over time.

7. **Top-Down Change Can Work—With Commitment**
Top-down approaches can be effective if leadership is aligned, willing to endure the discomfort, and open to adjusting course along the way.

8. **Iteration Works** 
Organizations can learn and evolve by trying, failing, and adapting. Progress can come through painful lessons. The present situation being less than ideal is not a terminal issue as long as there is a commitment towards iterative improvement.
