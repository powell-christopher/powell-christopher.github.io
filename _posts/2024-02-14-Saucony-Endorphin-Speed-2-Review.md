The Saucony Endorphin Speed 2 is a great running shoe. The Endorphin Speed line popularized TPU (plastic) plates in the daily-trainer category. This was also my own first experience with a plated shoe.

Starting from the upper, this is typical Saucony stuff, i.e. it is very solid and well made. It is comfortable and well ventilated and feels like it will last. I do feel like it could do with some further streamlining to further reduce weight, but absolutely nothing to complain about.

Onto the midsole, the best way I can describe it is that it is very protective. The PWRRUN PB based midsole is soft, but not as soft and squishy as say FuelCell from New Balance or Zoom X from Nike. It is however great at shock absorption. If you don't like the feeling of a very soft and squishy midsole you will actually prefer PWRRUN PB. The embedded TPU plate provides a slight propulsive effect. Nothing huge, and it was a very subtle feeling, but it did result in a slightly higher pace at a slightly lower HR. So it does work. When heel striking or midfoot striking, you get a very smooth transition (what Saucony calls their SpeedRoll technology). When forefoot striking, you compress the TPU plate more and you get more energy return. This combination of protective midsole, smooth transition and energy return makes the Saucony Endorphin Speed 2 a real jack of all trades shoe, from slow long runs up to tempo, threshold, intervals and even racing. Is it the best at all those things? No. But it certainly holds its own.

One thing to note about the midsole is that it is relatively narrow in the mid-foot. My feet are of average width and they are absolutely fine for me, but I can imagine runners with wide feet having some trouble with it. If you are such a runner I would recommend trying before buying.

Outsole is standard Saucony stuff. Saucony outsoles tend to be very resilient, but that comes at a cost in terms of grip (softer rubber wears out more quickly but grips better). This outsole will last a long time but wouldn't be my favourite in wet and slippery conditions. The Endorphin Speed 2 has a fair amount of exposed midsole in the right places to further alleviate weight. 

Speaking of weight, the shoe falls squarely into daily trainer territory. It is not heavy, but also not super light. It does feel light and comfortable on foot though.

In terms of value, the Saucony Endorphin Speed 2 is an expensive shoe with an RRP of around EUR 175. I got mine on sale for around EUR 140. Even discounted, it is an expensive shoe. However it is also one of the best shoes you can get outside of splurging on a full on racing shoe. Also, its flexibility means you will get a lot of use out of it, especially if you're a 'one pair of shoes' type of runner. This will basically handle everything well for you. Being a Saucony shoe, it will also last you a long time.

In terms of my rotation, the Saucony Endorphin Speed 2 is my up-tempo shoe. Not because it cannot do slower work or long distances, but I have other shoes which are better suited to those jobs.

Recommended.
